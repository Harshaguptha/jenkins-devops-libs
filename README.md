# Jenkins DevOps Shared Libraries

A collection of Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries for common DevOps software. Usage and library dependencies for each can be found in the documentation.

Unsure how to use these in your declarative syntax `Jenkinsfile`? Check the documentation here: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries

## TODO

- Terraform
- Packer
- Puppet
- Serverspec
- Else, replace all `sh` with API where possible
