# Jenkins DevOps Shared Libraries

A collection of Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries for common DevOps software. Usage and library dependencies for each can be found in the documentation.

Unsure how to use these in your declarative syntax `Jenkinsfile`? Check the documentation here: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries

Basically, if you have the GitHub Branch Source plugin installed, then you can load the current master branch like:

```groovy
@Library('github.com/mschuchard/jenkins-devops-libs')
```

If you do not have this plugin installed, or want more flexibility over the version used, then you can use or expand upon this class:

```groovy
library identifier: 'jenkins-devops-libs@master', retriever: modernSCM(
  [$class: 'GitSCMSource',
   remote: 'https://github.com/mschuchard/jenkins-devops-libs.git'])
```

Additionally, you can pare down the libraries available from this repo and then load those in yourself from your own git repo or otherwise.

## TODO

- Terraform
- Goss vars file
- Packer
- Puppet
- Serverspec
- Else, replace all `sh` with API where possible and abstract common methods into utils.
